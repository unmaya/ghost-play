## This is a testing / development environment
I'm making a theme for Ghost v0.3 - v0.4 and using this repo to deploy it as a Heroku App. The theme is mostly to test future versions of [Girder CSS](https://github.com/unmaya/Girder).

### Preview the Theme

### Want to use it?
Sure! Its still evolving but fully compatible with Ghost v.0.3 at its current state.

### Can you clone this and deploy it to Heroku
Yes, but... Ghost doesn't officially support Heroku yet, this code is experimental and highly modified to work in that environment. You've been warned but here are some things to note before you dive in:
	- Heroku does not have a persistent file system for your post attachments. Upload a nice image for your post and it may vanish without notice.
	- You'll need some basic knowledge of Nodejs environment and Postgres configuration to get this running

### Not much else to see at the moment :)
